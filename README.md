# Python code for Sutron Satlink 3 and XLink 500 data loggers

Sutron [Satlink 3](http://www.sutron.com/product/satlink3-loggertransmitter-sl3-1/) and [XLink 500](http://www.sutron.com/productsdisplay/66/95/) data loggers run Python scripts in order to provide advanced features that go beyond the standard setup.  Here are some examples:
* Water quality auto-sampler control
* Custom transmission formats
* Computing discharge and volume from a stage sensor
* Interfacing to unique RS-232, RS-485, and SDI-12 sensors
* Control applications
* RS-232 displays
